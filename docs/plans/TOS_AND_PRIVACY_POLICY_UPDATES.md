# Brainstorming: Terms of Service & Privacy Policy Updates for KYC

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the necessary updates to the GridTokenX Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy to incorporate the new Know Your Customer (KYC) process. These changes are critical for legal compliance, transparency, and user trust.

## 2. Terms of Service (ToS) Updates

The ToS must be updated to make the KYC process a mandatory condition for accessing full platform features.

### Key Sections to Add/Update:

1.  **User Eligibility and Verification**:
    *   **Requirement**: State clearly that while basic access is available, full trading capabilities, withdrawals, and governance participation are restricted to users who complete identity verification.
    *   **Tiers**: Briefly explain the tiered access system (e.g., Tier 1 vs. Tier 2) and the permissions associated with each.
    *   **Third-Party Provider**: Disclose that we use a specialized third-party service for identity verification. We don't need to name them in the ToS, but we must state that user data will be shared with them for this purpose.

2.  **User Obligations**:
    *   **Accurate Information**: Add a clause requiring users to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the KYC process.
    *   **Cooperation**: Users must consent to and cooperate with our identity verification checks.
    *   **Single Account**: Reinforce that each individual is allowed only one verified account.

3.  **Fees and Payments**:
    *   **KYC Fee**: If we proceed with the one-time fee model, this section must clearly state the cost for Tier 2 verification, its purpose (to cover processing costs), and that it is non-refundable.

4.  **Account Suspension and Termination**:
    *   **Grounds for Suspension**: Add new grounds for suspension/termination, including:
        *   Failure to pass KYC verification.
        *   Providing false or misleading information.
        *   Refusal to undergo verification when requested.
        *   Detection of duplicate verified accounts.

5.  **Consent**:
    *   Include an explicit statement where the user, by agreeing to the ToS, consents to the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information for the purpose of identity verification as described in the Privacy Policy.

## 3. Privacy Policy Updates

The Privacy Policy requires significant updates to detail what data is collected for KYC, why it's collected, and how it's handled.

### Key Sections to Add/Update:

1.  **Information We Collect**:
    *   **New Data Category**: Create a specific section for "Identity Verification Data."
    *   **Clarify What We Don't Store**: Explicitly state that we **do not** store sensitive data like copies of government IDs, selfies, or biometric data on our servers.
    *   **Data We Do Store**: Specify that we only receive and store the **result** of the verification (e.g., 'verified', 'rejected'), a reference ID, and the date of the check.
    *   **Data Collected by Provider**: Inform the user that our third-party provider will collect and process their government-issued ID, proof of address, and/or biometric data (for liveness checks) on our behalf.

2.  **How We Use Your Information**:
    *   **New Purposes**: Add the following purposes for data processing:
        *   "To verify your identity and comply with legal and regulatory obligations, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) requirements."
        *   "To prevent fraud, abuse, and ensure the security of our platform."
        *   "To enable access to enhanced features, such as higher trading limits and fund withdrawals."

3.  **Data Sharing and Third Parties**:
    *   **KYC Provider**: Name the category of the third party ("Identity Verification Services").
    *   **Purpose of Sharing**: State that data is shared with this provider for the sole purpose of conducting identity verification.
    *   **Link to Their Policy**: Recommend that users review the privacy policy of our KYC provider (we can provide a link if we choose a specific one).

4.  **Data Security and Retention**:
    *   **Security**: Reiterate that both GridTokenX and our chosen provider use industry-standard security measures to protect personal data.
    *   **Retention**:
        *   **Our Retention**: Specify how long we retain the verification *status* (e.g., "for as long as you maintain an account with us and for a certain period thereafter as required by law").
        *   **Provider's Retention**: Briefly mention that the provider has its own data retention schedule, which will be outlined in their privacy policy.

5.  **Your Rights and Choices**:
    *   **Access and Correction**: Remind users of their right to access and correct their personal information. For KYC data, this might mean re-initiating the verification process.
    *   **Deletion**: Explain that while users can request account deletion, we may be required to retain certain information (like the fact that KYC was completed) for legal and compliance reasons.
